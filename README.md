# root-simple-mcmc

A simple MCMC template for use with ROOT (tested with 5.34+ and 6.06+).  It
can be used as in a macro with ACLiC, or directly in C++ code.  See
"installation" below for how to include it in an external project.  While
multiple classes have been provided, the *only* one that I recommend is the
include-file-only TSimpleMCMC templated class (i.e. TSimpleMCMC.H).  I
consider it to be stable, and am using it in "production" code.

The TSimpleMCMC templated class runs an Markov Chain Monte Carlo using a
user provided likelihood and stepping proposal.  The resulting MCMC
normally uses default stepping proposal which implements an adaptive
proposal function.

The MCMC object is created with one required and one optional template argument.

```
typedef TSimpleMCMC<UserLikelihood> TUserMCMC;
```

or

```
typedef TSimpleMCMC<UserLikelihood,UserProposal> TUserMCMC;
```

The UserLikelihood template argument must be a class (or struct) which
provides a method declared as:

```
struct ExampleLogLikelihood {
   double operator() (const std::vector<double>& point);
}
```

The optional UserProposal template argument must be a struct (or class)
which provides a method declared as:

```
struct ExampleProposal {
   void operator() (std::vector<double>& proposed,
                      const std::vector<double>& previous,
                      const double previousValue);
}
```

where proposed is the new proposed point, previous is the last
accepted point, and previousValue is the log Likelihood at the
previous point.

This can be used in your root macros, or C++ code as follows.

```
class TDummyLogLikelihood {
public:
    double operator()(const Vector& point)  const {
        double logLikelihood = 0.0;
        for (std::size_t i = 0; i < point.size(); ++i) {
            logLikelihood += - 0.5*point[i]*point[i];
        }
        return logLikelihood;
    }
};

void SimpleMCMC() {

    TFile *outputFile = new TFile("simple-mcmc.root","recreate");
    TTree *tree = new TTree("SimpleMCMC",
                            "Tree of accepted points");

    TSimpleMCMC<TDummyLogLikelihood> mcmc(tree);

    // The next three lines are for example only and should almost never
    // be used.  They are documented in the TProposeAdaptiveStep header file.
    // This is to show the syntax for controlling TProposeAdaptiveStep, don't
    // just copy this blindly!
    mcmc.GetProposeStep().SetDim(5);          // Not bad for documentation!
    mcmc.GetProposeStep().SetGaussian(3,2.0); // Otherwise, sigma == 1
    mcmc.GetProposeStep().SetUniform(4,-5,5); // Maybe for a special case.
    mcmc.GetProposeStep().SetCorrelation(1,2,0.5)  // Set Correlation Coeff.
    mcmc.GetProposeStep().SetCorrelation(2,3,-0.7) // Set Correlation Coeff.

    Vector point(5);
    mcmc.Start(point);  // Set initial conditions

    // Invisible burn-in: This doesn't save any output and might be
    // useful to build a proposal covariance.
    for (int i=0; i<1000000; ++i) mcmc.Step(false);

    // This is the normal way to run the steps.
    for (int i=0; i<1000000; ++i) mcmc.Step();       // Run the chain.

    // Save the final state.  This is needed to force the proposal to save
    // it's final state so that the chain can be continued.
    mcmc.SaveStep();

    tree->Write();
    delete outputFile;
}
```

If this macro is in a file named "SimpleMCMC.C", then you can run it using

```
root -l -q SimpleMCMC.C+
```

Running it inside of ROOT requires that the macro be compiled so that it
uses "real" C++.  That means that in ROOT5, you must use ACLIC.  In ROOT 6,
the cling jit compilation is probably sufficient (it is still safer to
compile it first using the "+" suffix).

The default class for UserProposal is TProposeAdaptiveStep which
implements an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings step.  It has several methods
that can be accessed using the GetProposeStep() method.  See above for an
example.

# Working Example

The SimpleMCMC.C file contains a working example that I've used to
test the code.  It can be compiled into a standalone program using
mcmc-compile.sh and then run as mcmc.exe.  This test program takes
three optional arguments.  The first is the number of steps to take,
the second is the name of an output file for the chain, and the third
is the name of a file to read the starting point.  If all three
parameters are provided, then the input and output files represent a
single continued MCMC chain.  An example of running this might be

```bash
./mcmc-compile.sh
mcmc.exe 50000 mcmc1.root
mcmc.exe 50000 mcmc2.root mcmc1.root
mcmc.exe 50000 mcmc3.root mcmc2.root
```

# MCMC Versions Here

This repo actually contains a few different MCMC examples that I have
used to learn about the different types of behaviors.  Except for the
TSimpleMCMC.H classess, these examples are not intended as an end user
program, and I control a lot of the input parameters by editing the
source and recompiling (hey, it's test code).  However, the associated
TSimple<blah>.H classes generally work.

- TSimpleMCMC.H (and friends) : This is the adaptive MCMC described above.
It's the best tested class, and is my first choice when I'm looking at the
behavior of an MCMC.  An alternative for the proposal is provided by
TProposeGibbsStep.h (the Gibbs step is not adaptive).  I have used this
class in "production" environments.

- TSimpleHMC.H (and friends) : This is a "pure" Hamiltonian MC.  It handles
the relatively rare special case where you can write down the derivative of
the likelihood, but for the right problem it converges much more quickly.
It is less supported that TSimpleMCMC and is mostly for (my own) education.

- TSimpleAHMC.H (and friends) : This is an HMC implementation that uses an
approximate version of the gradient.  The gradient is estimated based on
the accumulated covariance of the posterior.  I avoid this because it's not
faster than TSimpleMCMC, and doesn't seem to be as reliable.  My feeling is
that it makes to many approximations.  It is less supported that
TSimpleMCMC and is mostly for (my own) education.

- BadGrad.C : This is just a toy to see how accurately the gradient needs to
be calculated.

# Other Tools

A (tiny) collection of other tools to look at the results of the MCMC
chains have been included.  In general, they are in the form of ROOT macros
(i.e. .C files), and have running instructions in the comments at the top
of the file.

- MakeCovariance.C : Read a root tree containing an MCMC chain (for example,
one produced by SimpleMCMC.C), and produce a covariance matrix for the
posterior.  The results are saved in histograms.

- CholeskyChain.C : Get the mean and covariance (as produced by
MakeCovariance.C) from a pair of histograms, and then produce a "chain"
using Cholesky Decomposition.

# Installation

The file TSimpleMCMC.H defines an include-file-only templated class, and
can be installed into a project by simply copying it to wherever your
include files are stored.  ROOT is required.  It provides the needed
libraries and include files using the ```root-config``` command.  The include
files can be found using ```root-config --cflags```, and the libraries can be
found using ```root-config --libs```
